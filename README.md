#  16-bit single-cycle MIPS processor
 The entire 16-bit single-cycle MIPS processor, including the ISA, assembler, and data  path, is simulated in this program. Our specified instruction set of architectures (ISA) composes  the processor. The assembly code is transformed into machine code using an assembler. The  assembler is created with the help of C++.
